# Car-Selling-Price-Machine Learning 
Predicting car selling prices using a machine learning model, a Random Forest Regressor. 
1. Preprocessing steps like encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and creating new features like the number of years a car has been owned.
2. Used techniques like feature importance to understand which features are most significant for the model.
3. Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for your Random Forest model.
4. Evaluated the model's performance using the mean squared error and predictions on the test set.
